# Probabilistic Stock Trading Agent

## Overview

This project develops a **goal-based probabilistic stock trading agent** designed to predict whether the next day’s stock *Close* price will exceed today’s. Our primary objective is to maximize profit while managing risk by combining advanced probabilistic models, state-of-the-art feature engineering, and reinforcement learning techniques.

Over the evolution of this project, we have achieved several key milestones:

- **Enhanced Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**  
  We incorporated technical indicators, lagged features, and discretization techniques (using quantile-based binning with winsorization) to robustly represent market dynamics.

- **Optimized Bayesian Network Modeling:**  
  We moved from a simple, fixed-structure baseline Bayesian network to an **Enhanced Bayesian Network** that leverages hyperparameter tuning and structure learning (via HillClimbSearch) to capture more nuanced relationships among market variables.

- **Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Integration:**  
  By fitting a Gaussian HMM on technical indicators, we infer latent market regimes (e.g., bull, bear, and stagnant markets) that enrich our feature space and improve model performance.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Trading Strategy:**  
  We implemented a Q-learning agent in a simulated trading environment to prototype an RL-based trading strategy that uses discretized market features and inferred HMM regimes.

## Project Achievements & Optimization Details

### 1. Advanced Data Processing & Feature Engineering

Before model training, the raw stock data undergoes a series of sophisticated preprocessing steps:

- **Winsorization**  
  We limit extreme values in critical features (e.g., *Close*, *High*, *Low*) to reduce the influence of outliers:
  
  ```python
  df = apply_winsorization(df, ['Close', 'High', 'Low'])
  ```
  
  *Why?*  
  Winsorization caps extreme values, ensuring that the subsequent discretization is not skewed by outliers, leading to more stable conditional probability estimates in our Bayesian networks.

- **Technical Indicators and Lagged Features**  
  Using `add_technical_indicators(df)`, we compute:
  
  - **ATR (Average True Range):** Measures market volatility.
  - **Bollinger Bands:** Captures standard deviation bounds around a moving average.
  - **Lagged Features:** Incorporates prior-day values (e.g., `Close_Lag1`, `Return_Lag1`) to capture temporal dependencies.
  
  ```python
  df = add_technical_indicators(df)
  ```
  
  *Impact:* These features provide a richer representation of market conditions, which, when discretized, yield more informative states for the network.

- **Discretization**  
  Continuous features are converted into categorical bins:
  
  ```python
  continuous_features = ['Close', 'ATR', 'BB_Middle', 'BB_Upper', 'BB_Lower', 'Return', 'Close_Lag1', 'Return_Lag1']
  df = discretize_features(df, continuous_features, num_bins=config['num_bins'], method=config['discretization_method'])
  ```
  
  *Why?*  
  Bayesian networks perform better with discrete states; using quantile-based binning preserves the distribution and ensures balanced bin frequencies.

- **Feature Selection with Preservation**  
  We remove highly correlated features while preserving essential ones:
  
  ```python
  preserve_cols = ['Open_binned', 'High_binned', 'Low_binned', 'ATR_binned', 'Return_binned', 'Close_binned', 
                   'BB_Middle_binned', 'BB_Upper_binned', 'BB_Lower_binned', 'Close_Lag1_binned', 'Return_Lag1_binned', 'Trend']
  df = feature_selection(df, target='Trend', threshold=0.95, preserve=preserve_cols)
  ```
  
  *Mathematical Rationale:*  
  Removing redundancy avoids overfitting and ensures that the network’s conditional probability tables (CPTs) are estimated from non-redundant, high-quality data.

### 2. Baseline vs. Enhanced Bayesian Network

Our project’s capstone is the optimization of the Bayesian network model. We build two models for comparison:

- **Baseline Bayesian Network:**  
  Uses a minimal feature set:
  
  ```python
  baseline_candidates = ['Open_binned', 'High_binned', 'Low_binned']
  baseline_features = [col for col in baseline_candidates if col in df.columns]
  ```
  
  The baseline network assumes a simple structure:
  
  ```python
  edges = [(feature, 'Trend') for feature in baseline_features]
  model = BayesianNetwork(edges)
  model.fit(df[baseline_features + ['Trend']], estimator=BayesianEstimator, prior_type='BDeu', equivalent_sample_size=15)
  ```
  
  *Limitations:*  
  This fixed structure may miss important market signals present in additional features.

- **Enhanced Bayesian Network:**  
  Our enhanced model extends the feature set:
  
  ```python
  enhanced_candidates = baseline_candidates + ['ATR_binned', 'Return_binned']
  enhanced_features = [col for col in enhanced_candidates if col in df.columns]
  ```
  
  **Optimization Logic:**
  
  1. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search):**  
     We run a grid search over Bayesian estimator parameters such as `equivalent_sample_size` and `prior_type`:
     
     ```python
     best_params = bn_trainer.grid_search_estimator(df, enhanced_features, 'Trend', cv_splits=config['cv_splits'])
     ```
     
     *Mathematical Insight:*  
     - **Equivalent Sample Size (ESS):** Balances the strength of the prior against the data evidence.
     - **Prior Type (BDeu):** Sets a uniform prior that smooths the CPTs.
     
     This tuning ensures that our probability estimates are neither too rigid (overly influenced by the prior) nor too noisy.
  
  2. **Structure Learning via HillClimbSearch:**  
     Instead of a fixed structure, we let the algorithm search for an optimal dependency structure:
     
     ```python
     structure_model = bn_trainer.learn_structure(df, enhanced_features + ['Trend'], seed=i)
     ```
     
     We restart the search several times to avoid local optima:
     
     ```python
     for i in range(bn_trainer.num_restarts):
         structure_model = bn_trainer.learn_structure(df, enhanced_features + ['Trend'], seed=i)
         # Evaluate on a validation split...
     ```
     
     *Why It Works:*  
     A learned structure can capture conditional dependencies between features (e.g., how volatility influences returns), leading to a more accurate and robust model.
  
  3. **Final Evaluation:**  
     The enhanced BN, with tuned parameters and learned structure, shows improved performance on the holdout set:
     
     ```python
     _, _, bn_accuracy, _ = bn_trainer.evaluate_model(enhanced_bn_model, test_df, enhanced_features, 'Trend')
     print(f"Final Holdout Accuracy -> Enhanced BN: {bn_accuracy:.4f}")
     ```
     
     *Outcome:*  
     The Enhanced BN outperforms the baseline by capturing additional market dynamics, as evidenced by a higher holdout accuracy.

### 3. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Market Regime Detection

The HMM integration further enriches our dataset by identifying latent market regimes:

```python
from hmmlearn.hmm import GaussianHMM
model = GaussianHMM(n_components=3, covariance_type="diag", n_iter=100, random_state=42)
latent_states = model.fit_predict(df[indicators].values)
df['Market_Regime'] = latent_states
```

**Explanation:**

- **Technical Indicators for HMM:**  
  Indicators such as `MA_20`, `RSI_14`, and `MACD` are used as features to fit the HMM.
  
- **Latent Market Regimes:**  
  The HMM clusters the data into 3 latent states, representing different market conditions (e.g., bull, bear, and stagnant).
  
- **Impact on the Model:**  
  These regimes are later added as a feature, further improving the predictive power of our Bayesian network.

*Code Snippet from `hmm_integration.py`:*

```python
def fit_hmm_on_indicators(df, indicators=['MA_20', 'RSI_14', 'MACD'], n_components=3):
    df_ind = df[indicators].dropna()
    X = df_ind.values
    model = hmm.GaussianHMM(n_components=n_components, covariance_type="diag", n_iter=100, random_state=42)
    latent_states = model.fit_predict(X)
    states_series = pd.Series(latent_states, index=df_ind.index, name='Market_Regime')
    df = df.join(states_series)
    df['Market_Regime'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
    return model, df
```

*Mathematical Impact:*  
Incorporating the HMM state into the feature set allows the Enhanced Bayesian Network to condition its predictions on latent market conditions, leading to better differentiation between market phases and improved accuracy.

### 4. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Integration

We have also prototyped a Q-learning agent to explore RL-based trading strategies. Although this README focuses on the Bayesian network optimization, our RL component demonstrates another frontier of decision-making in our system.

*Key Snippet from `rl_agent.py`:*

```python
class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, actions=['buy', 'sell', 'hold'], alpha=0.1, gamma=0.95, epsilon=0.1):
        self.q_table = {}
        self.actions = actions
        self.alpha = alpha      # Learning rate
        self.gamma = gamma      # Discount factor
        self.epsilon = epsilon  # Exploration rate

    def choose_action(self, state_features):
        state = tuple(state_features)
        if random.random() < self.epsilon or state not in self.q_table:
            return random.choice(self.actions)
        else:
            return max(self.q_table[state], key=self.q_table[state].get)

    def update_q_value(self, state_features, action, reward, next_state_features):
        state = tuple(state_features)
        next_state = tuple(next_state_features)
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = {a: 0.0 for a in self.actions}
        if next_state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[next_state] = {a: 0.0 for a in self.actions}
        max_future_q = max(self.q_table[next_state].values())
        current_q = self.q_table[state][action]
        new_q = current_q + self.alpha * (reward + self.gamma * max_future_q - current_q)
        self.q_table[state][action] = new_q
```

*Explanation:*

- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy:** Balances exploration and exploitation.
- **Q-table Update:** Uses the Bellman equation to iteratively refine Q-values based on received rewards.
- **Integration with Trading Environment:**  
  The `SimpleTradingEnv` class simulates the market, and the agent’s performance is evaluated by its cumulative reward over episodes.

*Impact:*  
This RL prototype offers a path toward developing adaptive trading strategies that could be integrated with our probabilistic models in future iterations.

## 5. Results & Comparative Analysis

### Performance Metrics

- **Baseline BN Accuracy:**  
  The baseline Bayesian network, which only uses basic discretized features (e.g., `Open_binned`, `High_binned`, `Low_binned`), achieved a cross-validation accuracy of approximately **55.7%**.
  
- **Enhanced BN Accuracy:**  
  By incorporating additional features (like `ATR_binned` and `Return_binned`), tuning hyperparameters via grid search, and optimizing the network structure with HillClimbSearch, our Enhanced Bayesian Network achieved a holdout accuracy of approximately **64.4%**.

### Why the Enhanced BN Outperforms the Baseline

1. **Richer Feature Set:**  
   Including indicators of volatility and returns provides the network with deeper insights into market dynamics.
   
2. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  
   The grid search over the Bayesian estimator’s parameters ensures that our CPTs are accurately estimated, striking the right balance between data and prior belief.
   
3. **Structure Learning:**  
   The use of HillClimbSearch with multiple restarts allows the model to discover a dependency structure that more accurately reflects the underlying relationships between features and the target.

4. **Incorporation of Latent Market Regimes (via HMM):**  
   The additional market regime feature further refines the model’s understanding of market states, enabling more context-aware predictions.

*Illustrative Code Snippet from `model_training.py`:*

```python
# Enhanced feature set
enhanced_candidates = baseline_candidates + ['ATR_binned', 'Return_binned']
enhanced_features = [col for col in enhanced_candidates if col in df.columns]

# Grid Search for optimal estimator parameters
best_params = bn_trainer.grid_search_estimator(df, enhanced_features, 'Trend', cv_splits=config['cv_splits'])

# Structure Learning with multiple restarts
best_structure_score = -np.inf
best_structure = None
for i in range(bn_trainer.num_restarts):
    structure_model = bn_trainer.learn_structure(df, enhanced_features + ['Trend'], seed=i)
    # Evaluate on a validation split...
    if acc > best_structure_score:
        best_structure_score = acc
        best_structure = structure_model
logging.warning(f"Best structure validation accuracy: {best_structure_score:.4f}")

# Final model training on full data using the best structure and parameters
enhanced_bn_model = BayesianNetwork(list(best_structure.edges()))
enhanced_bn_model.fit(df[enhanced_features + ['Trend']],
                      estimator=BayesianEstimator,
                      prior_type=best_params.get('prior_type', 'BDeu'),
                      equivalent_sample_size=best_params.get('equivalent_sample_size', 15))
```

*Mathematical Takeaway:*  
Each enhancement—whether through additional features, careful parameter tuning, or dynamic structure learning—works to refine the conditional probability distributions the network uses to predict trends. The improved accuracy is a direct result of better representing the uncertainty and complex relationships inherent in stock market data.
